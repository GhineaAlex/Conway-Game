Conway's Game of Life that follows the 4 rules with 2 approaches (Toroidal and Plan). 

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

You need to type T or P for Toroidal or Plan,  the number of lines for the game and the number of columns and the number of generations. 

After that you have to add the  matrix with 0 and 1. 

The result  will consist of the final matrix after k generations and the occupation level.
